# SmartParking

Finding a spot to park your car can be a frustratingly difficult task in big cities, you can
easily waste a lot of time and patience trying to do it. Our project aims to solve this problem by
developing a way to obtain real time information about available parking spots around the city and
make that information available to the general public through an easy to use interface, as well as
giving the users the possibility to reserve a parking spot.

This information along with the spot reserving option will be available through a mobile app
which will be developed in this project.

In order to achieve the objectives of this project we will be implementing a sensor/actuator
system. The sensor system will be sending our sensorsâ€™ data to a cloud server which will be processing
that data giving the users the possibility to access that information through the mobile app once
connected to the cloud. The actuator system will work together with the cloud server in order to
provide our users the possibility to reserve a parking spot through our mobile app.
